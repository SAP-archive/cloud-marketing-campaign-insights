## Building the UI Project

The UI folder contains an SAP UI5 project. Complete the following steps to build a project:

* Open the command line interface, and navigate to the [UI](/ui) folder.

* Run the “npm install” command. This creates “node_modules” folder.

* On success, run the “npm run build” command. This creates “dist” folder.

* Navigate to “dist” folder.

* Zip the contents of the folder. This zip file must be used for deploying the UI application on SAP Cloud Platform.

[Deploy the UI Application on SAP Cloud Platform](/docs/deploy-ui.md).
